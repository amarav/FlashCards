# Mobile UdaciFlashcards

  Udaciflashcards is the final project required to pass for the Udacity React Nanodegree program.
  Mobile flashcards is a react native application  (Android and iOS -) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.
  The project has been tested on Android.
